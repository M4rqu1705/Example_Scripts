Since PHP needs a server to run, we'll be installing Xammp software suite
which will give us an Apache server, PHP, MySQL and PHPMyAdmin to manage
databases. It is cross-platform, and there are other tools and we can set
up a lamp stack.


Procedural programming vs Object Oriented programming:
    1) Programming paradigm based on the concept of the procedure call,
       routines, subroutines or functions. These can be called out at any
       point of the program's execution including by other functions and
       itself. Part of its object is modularity, restrained scopes, and to
       break down programming task into a collection of variables, data
       structures, and subroutines.

    2) Programming paradigm based on the concept of objects which contain
       fields/attributes, procedures/methods and identifiers. Its main
       focus is to break down a programming task into objects that expose
       these characteristics of behavior/methods, data/attributes through
       the use of interfaces. Objects operates its "own" data structure

Types of Databases:
    MySQL
    PostGreSQL
    MongoDB - NoSQL databases

PHP = PHP Hypertext Preprocessor
Open-source, server side
Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP belong to the LAMP stack, and is a popular stack to
work with. 
    LAMP Stack:
        - Archetypal model of web service stacks named as an acronym of the
          names of its original four open-source components.
        - Interchangeable components and not limited to the original selection.
        - Suitable for dynamic web sites and web applications

Although it needs a server to run, in can be embedded into HTML using <?php ?>
PHP files NEED the correct ".php" file extension

While the server processes a user HTTP(S) request, PHP has the ability to use
extensions and databases. Afterwards, the server sends the output to the client. 

ONLY THE RESULT OF PHP SCRIPTS ARE SENT BACK. CLIENTS CANNOT SEE THE PHP CODE

Pros:
    - PHP is very flexible, which is a pro and con.
        * Less structure and less strict
    - Easy to learn compared to other server-side languages
        * Not typed (no need to define data types)
    - A lot of support, including good documentation and good community
    - Cross Platform and a lot of servers
    - Contains a lot of frameworks
        * Laravel
        * Symphony
        * CodeIgniter
    - Compatible with databases
        * MySQL
        * PostGreSQL
        * MongoDB

What can PHP do:
    - Create dynamic page content
    - Interact with other files on the server
    - Collect and process HTML forms
    - Send and receive cookies
        * Work with sessiones
    - Read, update, delete data from database
    - Implement acces control on the website
    - Encrypt data
