# Python
There are various experiments and projects in this folder.

### [Curses](./Modules/curses)
Module intended to create Textual User Interfaces. Does not have that much
documentation and any example is useful.

### [JSON](./Modules/json)
Essential for parsing json files or strings into usable data structures.

### [Microbit](./Modules/microbit)
Contains examples of basic use of components such as sensors and scrolling
display.

### [Os](./Modules/os)
File manipulation example. VERY useful for automating tedious file structure manipulation tasks

### [PyAutoGUI](./Modules/pyautogui)
I LOVE this module. It enables interaction between GUI and Python. Folder
includes location of specific aspects of images and a few useful projects

### [Regex](./Modules/re)
I've come to depend so much on regular expression on my projects. It
additionally contains scripts to remove certain types of patters (like page
numbers from PDFs turned to TXT files)

### [Turtle](./Modules/turtle)
Great for simple visualization projects

### [CodeQuest](./Projects/CodeQuest)
Includes practice problems from Code Quest competitions from 2016 to 2018
and the actual competition code for the 2019 competition

### [Feria de Clubes](./Projects/FeriadeClubes2018)
It is only a folder for showcase projects for the Computer Science Club

### [Jupyter Notebooks](./Projects/JupyterNotebooks)
Jupyter Notebooks I plan on filling as summary of most commonly used
functions and simple reference.

### [Pomodoro Timer](./Projects/Pomodoro%20timer)
Contains pomodoro timer projects which vary in complexity and
attractiveness. Most used one is the "primitivePomodoro.py" since it comes
with nice customizable sounds and can be simply run through the CMD file.

### [Snake](./Projects/Snake)
Simple snake game programmed for the Microbit. Includes demonstrative video!!

### [SRT File Generator](./Projects/srtFileGenerator)
Python script that helped me make subtitles for videos in a less manual,
more automated way. However, needs improvement since it only depends on CLI
and errors must be fixed manually inside of output file

### [Workspace Prepper](./Projects/WorkspacePrepper)
Noticed I took too long opening certain programs to begin a task I wanted to
do and quickly lost motivation because of this. To solve this problem I made "universal" way to
configure a workspace in a json file and quickly arrive at it with a
Windows Batch file. 

### [Python Crash Course](./PythonCrashCourse)
Jupyter Notebooks that meticulously summarize the chapters from the _Python
Crash Course_ book.

### [Sentdex Machine Learning](./sentdexMachineLearning)
Following Sentdex's Machine Learning with Python tutorials
