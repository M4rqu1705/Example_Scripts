# Pomodoro Timer
This simple pomodoro timer will automatically run the standard 25-5 minute
intervals with customizable tones. Just put the mp3 file inside the `sounds`
folder and rename the desired tone either `rest.mp3` or `work.mp3` and tada!  

Future improvements include pause-play functionalities with command shortcuts,
timer display, etc.
