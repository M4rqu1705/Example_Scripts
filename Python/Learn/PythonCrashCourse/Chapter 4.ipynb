    "## For loop\n",
    "In the specific case of lists, a **`for`** loop runs through all the entries in a list and performs the same task with each of these items.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "magicians = ['alice', 'david', 'carolina']\n",
    "for magician in magicians:\n",
    "    print(magician.title())\n",
    "```\n",
    "  - Looping is the most common way a computer automates repetitive tasks. In the `for` loop's case, the loop retrieves an item from the list and then executes the code inside it.\n",
    "    + The indented code below a `for` loop is considered *inside*  the loop\n",
    "    + Many times the `for` loop executes statements that use a value of a list (in the case above represented by the variable `magician`) retrieved sequentially, in the order they appear(in the case above, from the list `magicians`) \n",
    "    + Once inside the loop, the retrieved value can be manipulated\n",
    "      * The retrieved value does not point to the original list. If it is modified, once the loop is over, this change will be lost unless stored\n",
    "  - Any lines of code after and outside a `for` loop are excecuted 'normally'. The for loop was exited and will only run once\n",
    "    +  When a line of code below the `for` loop is not indented, the line is *outside*  the loop\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "my_list = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\n",
    "for number in my_list:\n",
    "    my_list.remove(number)\n",
